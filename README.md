# Project Name

## Overview

The project is a backend server application designed to integrate a pre-trained machine learning model for sentiment analysis with a secure file handling system. The primary objectives are to:

* Integrate a sentiment analysis machine learning model using VaderSentimentAnalysis.
* Implement secure file handling with MongoDB storage.
* Develop authentication using JWT for user registration, login, and access control.
* Utilize Express.js and MongoDB for building the server application.

### Key Features:

1. Machine Learning Model Integration: Analyze sentiment of text input and return results (positive, negative, or neutral) using VaderSentimentAnalysis.
2. Secure File Handling: Accept and securely store file uploads (audio, video, PDFs) in MongoDB with authentication and access controls.
3. NoSQL Database Integration: Integrate MongoDB for storing textual data for sentiment analysis and binary data for file storage.
4. Authentication System: Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality using JWT for secure authentication.

## Approach

### Technologies Used:
* Express.js: For building the server application and handling HTTP requests.
* MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing textual data and binary files.
* Passport.js: For implementing authentication with JWT.
* VaderSentimentAnalysis: Pre-trained machine learning model for sentiment analysis.
* Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads securely.
* dotenv: For managing environment variables.
* bcryptjs: For hashing passwords securely.
* jsonwebtoken: For generating and verifying JWT tokens.


### Architecture Decisions:
1. Modularization: Use separate routes, controllers, models, and middleware for better code organization and maintainability.
2. Middleware: Utilize middleware functions for authentication and file upload handling.
3. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for better resilience and debugging.
4. Security Measures: Employ HTTPS for secure transmission, validate input data to prevent injection attacks, and hash passwords before storing in the database.
5. Performance Optimization: Implement file upload limits and rate limiting to improve performance and prevent abuse.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jahnavi02/aspireit
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    cd project-directory
    npm install
    ```
3. Configure environment variables:
    Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

    ```
    PORT=3000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://jahnavig310:I8zGv77bTRAnSMEb@cluster0.xjkuhfp.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```

4. Start the server:
    ```
    node server.js
    ```
5. Access the application:
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
